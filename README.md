# Marketplace Auction Web App

This project is a web-based marketplace for auctioning used/new items. It supports functionalities such as live bidding, product details viewing, chatting between buyers and sellers, and a QR code-based verification system for acquired items.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **QR Code Generation**: `qrcode` for Node.js, `qrcode.react` for React
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Implementation Details

The Marketplace Auction Web App is structured as a monorepo containing both frontend and backend code. This section outlines the implementation approach for key components of the tech stack.

### Frontend (React.js)

The frontend is implemented with React.js, leveraging functional components and hooks for state management. Redux or the Context API is used for global state management across components. The application is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), enhancing user experience with features like offline capabilities and home-screen installation.

- **Components**: Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Input) and pages (e.g., Home, ProductDetails).
- **Styles**: Styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling, aiming for a modular and maintainable CSS architecture.
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.IO client for real-time bidding and chatting functionalities.

### Backend (Node.js)

The backend is built with Node.js, using Express.js to handle HTTP requests and routes. It interacts with MongoDB for data persistence, ensuring efficient handling of auction items, user data, and bids. Real-time communication is facilitated by Socket.IO.

- **Controllers**: Business logic for handling user requests (e.g., createAuction, placeBid).
- **Models**: Mongoose models to define schemas for the data stored in MongoDB (e.g., User, AuctionItem).
- **Routes**: Express routes to define API endpoints (e.g., /api/auctions, /api/users).

### Database (MongoDB)

MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility and performance in handling large volumes of data and its dynamic schema, which is ideal for the varied data involved in auctions.

### Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)

Socket.IO is used to implement real-time communication for features like live bidding and chatting. It enables bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

### QR Code Generation

QR codes are generated for transaction verification using `qrcode` in Node.js backend and displayed using `qrcode.react` in the React frontend.

### Caching (Redis)

Redis is employed for caching frequently accessed data such as auction listings and bid history to enhance application performance.

### Authentication (JWT)

JWT is utilized for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that users can safely perform actions within the application.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`, each containing the respective source code, dependencies, and configuration files.
